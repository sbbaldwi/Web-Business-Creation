            This week went pretty good for the most part. I started filling out applications to join affiliate programs
            for some companies I personally would feel comfortable recommending in my blog, such as Chewy. I also
            finished up my home page and have started doing keyword research and creating a general layout for all my
            blog posts. I decided to just do the dog training blog because of the amount of time I have to spend is
            pretty limited this semester. After doing some research, I decided I will make my business a sole
            proprietorship because it is the easiest and most applicable to what I am trying to do. I am just starting
            out right now and I don't expect to be super successful off the bat, so I don't think I will have a lot to
            worry about. But that is basically this week so far. I am hoping over the weekend I will be able to get a
            few blog posts completed as well so I have a good head start on content.
