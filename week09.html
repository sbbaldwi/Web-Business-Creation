            This week went great. I got my Google Ad score at excellent which I think is pretty good. I got more
            affiliate links from Amazon and made a few more blog posts with them. I changed my Google Ad so that it
            sends
            people to my blog page because it was originally set to go to my homepage which I don't want. I also am
            working on getting approval for Google Adsense. I tried already but I didn't have the privacy law
            requirements met yet and I do now so hopefully it gets approved this time. Overall this week was pretty
            good. Not related to this assignment but sort of related to this class, I got a job in digital marketing at
            Idaho Central Credit Union at their Headquarters and I start on Monday part-time then full-time after I
            graduate in July. I am very excited about that. I am excited to apply a lot of what I learned in this class
            at my new job. I am excited to see how my Google Ad does and hopefully finish the semester strong!
