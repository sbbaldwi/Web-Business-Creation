            I am a bit confused this week because some assignments sound like we are already supposed to have our Google
            Ad live, but others explicitly say to not start it yet. So I have not started my Ad yet, I just created and
            planned it but it is not live. Other than the confusion on when the ad is supposed to go live, I think this
            week went pretty good. I saw your video on my website so far and I completely did not realize the picture I
            put on there so it was definitely not intentional lol. I got all my images from pixabay and I just looked up
            pictures of dogs so I guess that was one I used and I just didn;t look at it closely enough. But I think I
            changed the picture you were talking about. The video you sent the screen was black the whole time so it was
            hard to tell which picture you were talking about. But I did get some affiliate links through amazon for my
            blog. I didn't add a paypal button or anything because I thought it was weird for me to just ask for money
            on the website. But my plan to earn money was through affiliate links and Google Ads, which I am still
            trying to figure out. I got the codes from google to add to my blog posts for the google ads, but they are
            not working for some reason so I will have to play around with that a little bit. But the affiliate links
            are working. The last thing I am not sure about is for the google ads, I am doing a blog which means I want
            people to visit my blog posts more than my website homepage. When i run my google ad, how should I make sure
            the people who see my add are taken to the blog post related to what they searched instead of my homepage?
            Or do I need to make an individual google ad for each blog post?
