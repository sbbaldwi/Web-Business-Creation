            It was interesting to see how my opinions changed as I did more research and looked at other discussion
            board responses. I will say I have never had a class where I felt like I learned as much as I am from a
            discussion board. I also learned that sometimes the easiest option is not the best option. I think for drop
            shipping or affiliate marketing, the team should go with drop shipping. And my original discussion board
            post was a different opinion. But because drop shipping and affiliate marketing had a very similar score in
            my excel comparison, and thinking about their team size, I decided that drop shipping is better. Just
            because affiliate marketing was slightly easier for them to do does not mean it will be the best for their
            team. I think the teams area of expertise, and capabilities, better align with drop shipping than with
            affiliate marketing. So that was my final answer. I appreciate the different opinions and perspectives
            everyone has. I think the discussion boards this week were thought provoking and I learned a lot.
