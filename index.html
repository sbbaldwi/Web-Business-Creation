            This week went pretty good! It was interesting to see peoples opinions and ideas about each of the
            discussion boards. I thought it was cool to see how differently people think and that there isn't one right
            answer. I struggled a lot with the Google ads set up but I think I got it figured out now which is good. I
            also struggled coming up with 20 different business Ideas. I asked ChatGPT for a few ideas which helped, but
            my favorite ideas, and the idea that I think will do the best, were ones I came up with myself.

            After filling out the excel sheet, the business idea I chose was a cookie dough business with a
            manufacturing business model. As far as the exact product goes, I have 2 options and I want to try both and
            see which works better. My mother in law has a freeze dryer, and one idea I had was freeze dried cookie
            dough bites. This would be the easier idea of the two. The other idea I had was putting the dry ingredients
            for a few different cookie dough recipes into jars and selling that. And my idea with this is we offer fun
            cookie dough flavors, similar to Crumbl, that most customers wouldn't have the ingredients or time at home
            to make. If you think about it, most people usually just make chocolate chip cookies because they don't want
            to spend a lot of money on extra ingredients they will only use once for a specialty cookie dough flavor.
            But if we put together most of the ingredients, the customer only has to add the wet ingredients and bake
            the cookies. It saves time, energy, and a trip to the store. Not to mention it would be easy to ship because
            the dry ingredients in cookies do not expire in a short amount of time. This is my favorite idea but it
            would take a lot more work.
