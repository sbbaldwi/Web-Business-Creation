            I ran my ad for about 7 days and spent $3/day for a few days then $5/day. Overall I got about 1.5k
            impressions and 34 clicks from my ad so far. I stopped the Ad at the beginning of the week. One thing that
            has surprised me a lot is I am also getting a very decent amount of organic traffic on my website, because
            my website has gotten over 100 unique clicks. I changed a few small things on my website this week like
            making the blog the homepage, however my old homepage still exists on the site. I just changed it so when
            someone sees my website and click on it, the url https://puppedupdogtraining.com takes them to the blog
            page. I think so far my website is doing great. I am even ranking in the top 100 for 3 of my keywords but I
            do want to make that higher. My goal is to be in the top 3 for at least 3 keywords once I have done some
            more to optimize my website. As my first website I have made that is not for a job, just on the side, I
            think it is doing pretty good so far. I would like to be getting more conversions because that is where I am
            lacking the most. I have seen that my affiliate links on amazon have gotten a few clicks so far but nobody
            has bought anything. I set it up as a conversion if someone looks at my blog page because that is one thing
            I want people to do since it is the main page on my site. I got a lot of those but those conversions don't
            earn any money. I got 2 PayPal donations so far though which is pretty good with the amount of clicks I
            have.
