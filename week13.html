            Yay! The semester is almost done and I feel pretty good about this class! I think this week was great, it
            was interesting learning about more ways I can optimize my website. My original optimization score was I
            think 82 which isn't the worst in the world but there of course is room for improvement. I will be doing
            what I can to optimize my site even more and I hope to continue working on this project after I graduate. It
            has been really fun for me. I think the next thing I will do is add a plugin called wp Rocket, which allows
            you to minify Javascript and CSS on your website, and optimize all images for you. It will be very helpful
            in decreasing my site load time which will also boost my optimization score. I will also use photoshop to
            optimize all of my images to the correct size and Photoshop can export images for web as well. This makes
            the file size of each image smaller and you can name the images according to what they will be on the site.
