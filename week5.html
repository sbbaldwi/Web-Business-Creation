            I was a bit confused with the assignments this week because I am doing a blog with ads and affiliate links.
            Because I am not selling any products, I got confused because I saw we were required to have a paypal button
            or some kind of payment option on our website but that would not apply in my case. So I completed the
            assignments this week to the best of my ability but I have not added any buttons for payment to my actual
            site because I am not selling anything so it doesn't make sense. I hope that is okay. Besides that, I think
            this week went very well. I am done with my overall site design, but I plan on making at least 4 blog posts
            a week. I have a lot of experience running blogs because I am currently in charge of 7 different blogs at my
            job. I think because of my experience, I can do about 4 blog posts a week without it taking me an extreme
            amount of time. I applied with Chewy to add affiliate links of their products on my blog, and will be doing
            the same for a few other dog brands that I can support from experience. I also created an account with
            Google Adsense and will add some ads to a few blog posts as well.
