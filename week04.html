            I do most of the things we will do in this class on a daily basis for my job. Not saying I am any good at
            this kind of stuff, but that I am familiar with it and have some experience. While completing the
            assignments this week, I started to notice a bad habit of mine. I use many resources for my job because
            those are the resources my boss prefers. After looking into so many different options I realized there are a
            lot of really good options for different things that I would have never considered. I tend to stick with
            what I know because I spent so much time learning how to use it already, but I think I need to be more open
            to other resources that might be more helpful to me depending on the project. So I think what I learned the
            most this week is there is so many options to choose from, and there likely is more than one option that
            will fit what you are looking for. Also, one thing I am excited about is if I do the Taylor Swift blog idea
            which I think is my top choice, the domain taylorswifteastereggs.com is available so I got it, and that will
            be very helpful for SEO and getting organic traffic on my blog. I got a deal with my hosting provider to get
            2 domain names instead of 1, and the host I chose allows me to create up to 100 websites with my
            subscription. So I also got a domain called puppedupdogtraining.com which is a play on words, like pumped up
            but its pupped up lol. So I can do either, or maybe even both ideas. I have no idea what I am going to do
            yet. But if you could, I would love if you had any insight on if I should do a dog training blog or a Taylor
            Swift blog.
