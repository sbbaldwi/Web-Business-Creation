            This week I started my google ad. It performed really well at first and I got a pretty good amount of
            impressions and clicks. I had an error with my conversion tracking code for some reason and so at first I
            wasn't tracking my conversions. By the time I got the conversion tracking code to work, I suddenly stopped
            getting impressions and clicks on my ad. I am not sure why but I haven't got any new impressions or clicks
            the last 3 days so I am trying to troubleshoot that. I changed the daily budget for my ad to $5/day instead
            of 3 to see if that helps because so far my ad only costs like $6. My ad optimization score is 100% so I am
            not sure why I stopped getting new impressions and clicks but hopefully it gets figured out soon. I have
            also been waiting for the last 2 weeks for my website to be approved for Google Adsense so I can get some
            ads on my blogs as well. Hopefully that happens soon because that will be another income source from the
            blog, but we will see.
